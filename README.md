        {
            ApiCredentials = new ApiCredentials("your-api-key", "your-api-secret"),
            // Make sure you set correct environment (mainnet/testnet) if needed
        });

        var result = await client.UnifiedApi.Withdraw.WithdrawAsync(
            coin: "BTC",
            chain: "BTC", // Or use "ETH", "ERC20", etc.
            address: "your-self-custodial-wallet-address",
            tag: null, // Optional for coins like XRP that require tag/memo
            amount: 0.001m, // Amount to withdraw
            accountType: AccountType.Unified, // Or AccountType.Contract, AccountType.Spot, etc.
            fee: null, // Optional; usually automatically calculated
            forceChain: false // Optional; set true to force withdraw on given chain

```

```
var socketClient = new BybitSocketClient();
var tickerSubscriptionResult = socketClient.V5SpotApi.SubscribeToTickerUpdatesAsync("ETHUSDT", (update) =>
